## üîÑ Data Relationships

### Primary Relationships

1. **Platform Events ‚Üí Prices**
   - One-to-many relationship
   - Connected via `event_id` foreign key
   - Cascade delete on event removal

2. **Platform Events ‚Üí Unique Events**
   - Many-to-one relationship
   - Platform events map to single unique event
   - Enables cross-platform event matching

3. **Events ‚Üí Canonical Venues**
   - Many-to-one relationship
   - All events link to standardized venue
   - Through `canonical_venue_id` foreign key

4. **Prices ‚Üí Price History**
   - Current snapshot vs historical tracking
   - Same structure, different purposes
   - History preserves all states

## üó∫Ô∏è Geolocation System

### Coordinate Storage
- Stored as JSONB: `{"lat": 41.0082, "lng": 28.9784}`
- Indexed with GIN for efficient spatial queries
- Available in both event and venue tables

### Coverage
- All Bubilet events have coordinates
- Biletix events have coordinates
- Other platforms use venue-based coordinates
- Canonical venues provide fallback coordinates

### Query Examples
```sql
-- Find events within radius (using PostGIS)
SELECT * FROM unique_events 
WHERE ST_DWithin(
  ST_MakePoint((coordinates->>'lng')::float, (coordinates->>'lat')::float)::geography,
  ST_MakePoint(28.9784, 41.0082)::geography,
  5000 -- 5km radius
);

-- Get events with coordinates
SELECT e.*, c.coordinates 
FROM unique_events e
JOIN canonical_venues c ON e.canonical_venue_id = c.id
WHERE c.coordinates IS NOT NULL;
```

---

## üí∞ Price Tracking System

### Snapshot-Based Architecture
- **INSERT-only approach**: Never update existing records
- **Complete state capture**: Each snapshot represents full price state
- **Historical preservation**: All price changes tracked
- **Efficient querying**: UUID-based snapshot retrieval

### Price Status Values
- `'active'` - Tickets available for purchase
- `'sold_out'` - Category sold out
- `'inactive'` - No longer offered

### Common Queries
```sql
-- Get current prices for an event
SELECT * FROM ticketing_platforms_raw_data.bubilet_prices
WHERE event_id = 123 
AND snapshot_id = (
  SELECT MAX(snapshot_id) 
  FROM ticketing_platforms_raw_data.bubilet_prices 
  WHERE event_id = 123
);

-- Track price changes over time
SELECT 
  date_trunc('day', created_at) as date,
  category,
  AVG(price) as avg_price,
  MIN(price) as min_price,
  MAX(price) as max_price
FROM ticketing_platforms_raw_data.biletix_price_history
WHERE event_id = 456
GROUP BY date_trunc('day', created_at), category
ORDER BY date;

-- Find sold out events
SELECT DISTINCT e.* 
FROM ticketing_platforms_raw_data.passo_events e
JOIN ticketing_platforms_raw_data.passo_prices p ON e.id = p.event_id
WHERE p.status = 'sold_out'
AND p.snapshot_id = (
  SELECT MAX(snapshot_id) 
  FROM ticketing_platforms_raw_data.passo_prices 
  WHERE event_id = e.id
);
```

---

## üîç Key Indexes

### Performance Optimization
Each table has strategic indexes for common queries:

**Event Tables:**
- Primary key on `id`
- Unique constraint on `(name, venue, date)`
- GIN index on `coordinates` for spatial queries
- B-tree indexes on `date`, `genre`, `venue`

**Price Tables:**
- Primary key on `id`
- Foreign key index on `event_id`
- B-tree index on `snapshot_id`
- Composite indexes for time-based queries

**Unique Events:**
- Multiple indexes on foreign keys
- GIN indexes on array fields (`artist`, `promoter`)
- Date-based indexes for timeline queries
- Venue and genre indexes for filtering

## üí° Implementation Notes for Artist/Promoter Features

### For Map Platform Integration

1. **Artist-Based Discovery**
   - Show events by artist popularity (Spotify listeners)
   - Artist tour routing on map
   - Similar artist recommendations
   - Genre-based clustering

2. **Promoter Intelligence**
   - Display promoter badges on events
   - Show campaign-backed events
   - Promoter reliability scoring
   - Multi-promoter collaborations

3. **Provider Analytics**
   - Platform availability indicators
   - Price comparison across providers
   - Provider-specific promotions
   - Marketing campaign visibility

### Data Quality Considerations

1. **Artist Normalization**
   - Multiple normalization levels ensure matching
   - Merged duplicates tracked via `merged_into`
   - Spotify data validates artist identity

2. **Campaign Matching**
   - `match_confidence` indicates campaign-event link quality
   - Manual review for low-confidence matches
   - Ad archive IDs enable verification

3. **Provider Coverage**
   - Not all events have provider campaigns
   - TikTok metrics limited to active accounts
   - Google Ads data depends on transparency settings

---

## üîê Data Integrity

### Constraints
- Foreign key relationships enforced
- Unique constraints on natural keys
- NOT NULL on critical fields
- Check constraints on status values

### Data Quality
- 98-100% platform relationship validity
- Comprehensive venue standardization
- Consistent date/time handling (timezone-aware)
- Array field normalization

---

## üöÄ API Access Patterns

### For Map View Platform

1. **Get Events by Location**
```sql
-- Events near a point with venue details
SELECT 
  e.*,
  v.name as venue_name,
  v.coordinates,
  v.city,
  array_agg(DISTINCT p.provider) as available_on
FROM unique_events e
JOIN canonical_venues v ON e.canonical_venue_id = v.id
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT event_id, 'bubilet' as provider FROM ticketing_platforms_raw_data.bubilet_events
  UNION ALL
  SELECT event_id, 'biletix' FROM ticketing_platforms_raw_data.biletix_events
  -- ... other platforms
) p ON p.event_id IN (e.bubilet_event_id, e.biletix_event_id, ...)
WHERE v.coordinates IS NOT NULL
AND e.date > NOW()
GROUP BY e.id, v.id;
```

2. **Get Event Prices**
```sql
-- Current prices across all platforms for an event
WITH event_prices AS (
  -- Get prices from each platform
  SELECT price, category, 'bubilet' as platform 
  FROM ticketing_platforms_raw_data.bubilet_prices
  WHERE event_id = (SELECT bubilet_event_id FROM unique_events WHERE id = $1)
  AND snapshot_id = (SELECT MAX(snapshot_id) FROM ...)
  
  UNION ALL
  
  SELECT price, category, 'biletix' as platform
  FROM ticketing_platforms_raw_data.biletix_prices
  WHERE event_id = (SELECT biletix_event_id FROM unique_events WHERE id = $1)
  -- ... continue for all platforms
)
SELECT 
  MIN(price) as min_price,
  MAX(price) as max_price,
  array_agg(DISTINCT platform) as platforms,
  array_agg(DISTINCT category) as categories
FROM event_prices;
```

3. **Search Events**
```sql
-- Full-text search with filters
SELECT * FROM unique_events
WHERE 
  to_tsvector('english', name || ' ' || COALESCE(description, '')) 
  @@ plainto_tsquery('english', $1)
  AND date BETWEEN $2 AND $3
  AND genre = ANY($4)
  AND canonical_venue_id = ANY($5)
ORDER BY date;
```

## üîÑ Data Update Cycle

### Scraping Schedule
- Automated scrapers run periodically
- Each platform scraped independently
- Snapshot created per scraping run
- Historical data preserved

### Update Process
1. Scraper fetches current platform data
2. Events upserted (update or insert)
3. New price snapshot created
4. Venue standardization triggered
5. Unique events table updated
6. Analytics views refreshed

---

## üí° Implementation Notes for Map Platform

### Key Considerations

1. **Coordinate Availability**
   - Not all events have coordinates
   - Use canonical venue coordinates as fallback
   - Consider clustering for performance

2. **Real-time Pricing**
   - Prices change frequently
   - Always query latest snapshot
   - Consider caching strategy

3. **Cross-platform Events**
   - Same event may appear on multiple platforms
   - Use unique_events for deduplication
   - Show price comparison opportunity

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use spatial indexes for map queries
   - Implement pagination for large result sets
   - Consider materialized views for complex queries

5. **Data Freshness**
   - last_seen indicates data age
   - Consider showing data freshness to users
   - Handle stale data gracefully

### Recommended Tech Stack Integration

**Backend:**
- PostGIS for spatial queries
- GraphQL/REST API for data access
- Redis for caching frequently accessed data
- WebSocket for real-time price updates

**Frontend:**
- Mapbox/Google Maps for visualization
- Marker clustering for performance
- Filter system using indexes
- Price comparison widgets

## üìù Sample Integration Code

### Node.js/TypeScript Example
```typescript
interface Event {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  venue: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    coordinates: { lat: number; lng: number };
    city: string;
  };
  date: Date;
  prices: {
    min: number;
    max: number;
    platforms: string[];
  };
}

async function getEventsNearLocation(
  lat: number, 
  lng: number, 
  radiusKm: number
): Promise<Event[]> {
  const query = `
    SELECT 
      e.id,
      e.name,
      e.date,
      v.id as venue_id,
      v.name as venue_name,
      v.coordinates,
      v.city
    FROM unique_events e
    JOIN canonical_venues v ON e.canonical_venue_id = v.id
    WHERE ST_DWithin(
      ST_MakePoint((v.coordinates->>'lng')::float, (v.coordinates->>'lat')::float)::geography,
      ST_MakePoint($1, $2)::geography,
      $3
    )
    AND e.date > NOW()
    AND e.status = 'active'
    ORDER BY e.date
    LIMIT 100;
  `;
  
  // Execute query and transform results
  return db.query(query, [lng, lat, radiusKm * 1000]);
}
```

## üÜò Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Coordinates**: Check canonical_venues table
2. **Duplicate Events**: Review unique_events matching logic
3. **Price Discrepancies**: Verify snapshot_id usage
4. **Venue Mismatches**: Check manual_venue_map overrides

### Monitoring Queries
```sql
-- Check data freshness
SELECT 
  'bubilet' as platform,
  COUNT(*) as total_events,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE last_seen > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours') as fresh_events
FROM ticketing_platforms_raw_data.bubilet_events
UNION ALL
-- Repeat for other platforms

-- Find venues needing coordinates
SELECT * FROM canonical_venues 
WHERE coordinates IS NULL 
AND id IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT canonical_venue_id 
  FROM unique_events 
  WHERE date > NOW()
);

-- Check price snapshot health
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT snapshot_id) as snapshots,
  COUNT(DISTINCT event_id) as events_priced
FROM ticketing_platforms_raw_data.bubilet_prices
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```
