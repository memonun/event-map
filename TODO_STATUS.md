# Project Todo Status Report

## Summary
- **Total Todos**: 38
- **Completed**: 34 ✅
- **Partially Complete**: 3 ⚠️
- **Failed/Skipped**: 1 ❌

---

## Phase 1: Initial Airbnb-Style Implementation

### Layout & Navigation
- ✅ Remove traditional header/tabs layout - create full-screen map
- ✅ Create floating search bar (top center)
- ✅ Create floating user menu (top right)
- ✅ Add floating toggle button for side panel

### Map Features
- ✅ Implement 3-tier smart clustering system (city → major venues → all venues)
- ✅ Design larger, more visible markers
- ✅ Remove 500 event limit - implement dynamic loading

### UI Components
- ✅ Create sliding venue details panel
- ✅ Build 2-column event grid for venues
- ✅ Design modern color scheme (white/black/red/orange)
- ✅ Test new Airbnb-style interface

---

## Phase 2: User Feedback Implementation

### Critical Issues Identified
- ⚠️ **Two-column event listing**: Initially broken, now fixed but only on larger screens (lg:grid-cols-2)
- ✅ **No constant side panel**: Fixed with UniversalEventPanel
- ✅ **Filters not working**: Fixed filtering logic in SmartClusterMap
- ✅ **No event detail modal**: Created EventDetailModal (80% viewport)
- ✅ **No ticket URLs**: Implemented application-layer fetching

### Service Enhancements
- ✅ Create service method to fetch ticket URLs from raw platform tables
- ✅ Update event interfaces to include ticket_urls array
- ✅ Implement dynamic genre loading from actual database data
- ✅ Fix filtering logic in smart cluster map to respect search parameters
- ✅ Update venue panel to display platform-specific Buy Tickets buttons
- ✅ Create EventDetailsPage component for detailed event information
- ✅ Add expandable EventListPanel to show all events in map view
- ✅ Enhance search service with better filtering capabilities

### Performance
- ⚠️ **Implement pagination and virtual scrolling**: Basic pagination implemented, virtual scrolling pending
- ✅ Add event card hover effects and visual improvements
- ⚠️ **Implement price range and advanced filtering**: Basic filtering done, price range pending

---

## Phase 3: Critical Bug Fixes

### Search & Filtering
- ✅ Fix event limit bug - remove 100 cap in searchEvents
- ✅ Fix city filter - handle venue relationship correctly
- ✅ Fix genre uncategorized value - use '__uncategorized__' instead of null
- ✅ Remove duplicate useEffect in smart-cluster-map
- ✅ Fix fallback to respect filters or remove it
- ✅ Test all filtering functionality works properly

### Initialization Errors
- ✅ Fix circular dependency in AirbnbStyleMapPlatform (loadPanelEvents)
- ✅ Fix initialization order in EventDetailModal (loadTicketUrls)

---

## Phase 4: Final Polish

### Display Issues
- ✅ Fix time display issue - only show time if not 00:00
- ✅ Fix artist display to handle null for standup/theater events

### Documentation
- ✅ Update README.md with Airbnb interface documentation
- ✅ Create TODO_STATUS.md with complete todo audit

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. **Database Query Assumptions**: Assumed Supabase could filter nested relationships directly
2. **Arbitrary Limits**: Added 100-event cap that severely limited functionality
3. **Testing Gap**: Didn't test filters with real data early enough
4. **Initialization Order**: React hooks dependency issues not caught initially

### What Went Right
1. **Airbnb-Style Interface**: Successfully implemented floating UI pattern
2. **Smart Clustering**: 3-tier system works efficiently with large datasets
3. **Application-Layer Approach**: Ticket URL fetching on-demand is performant
4. **Dynamic Data Loading**: Genre dropdown populated from real database

### Future Improvements
1. ❌ **Virtual Scrolling**: Implement react-window for large lists
2. ⚠️ **Price Range Filter**: Add min/max price filtering
3. ⚠️ **Map Bounds Filtering**: Panel should update based on visible map area
4. **Error Handling**: Add user-friendly error toasts
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Add analytics for filter usage

## Technical Debt

### To Be Addressed
- Virtual scrolling for event lists (performance)
- Price range filtering UI components
- Map bounds integration with panel
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Unit tests for filtering logic
- E2E tests for critical user flows

### Known Limitations
- City filter works post-fetch (not ideal for large datasets)
- No offline support
- Limited mobile optimization
- No saved filter preferences

---

## Current State

The platform is now fully functional with:
- ✅ Working real-time filters
- ✅ Airbnb-style toggleable side panel
- ✅ Large event detail modal with ticket URLs
- ✅ Dynamic genre loading from database
- ✅ Proper handling of all event types (concerts, standup, theater)
- ✅ Clean display of event times and artist information

All critical bugs have been fixed and the platform successfully displays and filters the full 5,240+ event database.
