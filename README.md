For detailed database documentation, see `DATABASE_DOCUMENTATION.md`.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- Supabase project with the event database
- (Optional) Mapbox account for map functionality

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd event-map
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create `.env.local`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   
   # Optional: For map functionality
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_access_token
   ```

3. **Set up the database**
   
   Run the spatial functions in your Supabase SQL editor:
   ```bash
   # Copy and execute the contents of:
   supabase/migrations/create_spatial_functions.sql
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.

## Database Setup

### Required Functions

The application requires several PostGIS functions for efficient spatial queries. Run these in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- See supabase/migrations/create_spatial_functions.sql for complete setup
```

Key functions include:
- `get_events_near_location()` - PostGIS spatial search
- `get_events_in_bounds()` - Map bounds filtering  
- `get_popular_genres()` - Genre statistics
- `get_cities_with_venues()` - City listings

### Row Level Security

Ensure your Supabase policies allow:
- Public read access to events and venues
- Authenticated user access to personal data

## Usage

### Map View

- **Navigation**: Use mouse/touch to pan and zoom
- **Clustering**: Events are automatically clustered for performance
- **Event Details**: Click markers to see event information
- **Geolocation**: Allow location access for nearby events

### List View

- **Search**: Search across event names, artists, and venues
- **Filters**: Filter by genre, city, date range, and platforms
- **View Modes**: Switch between grid and compact list views
- **Load More**: Pagination with "load more" functionality

### Event Information

Each event displays:
- Event name, date, and time
- Venue with capacity and location
- Artist lineup with Spotify data
- Available platforms and pricing
- Genre and promoter information

### Key Services

- **EventsService**: Event querying and search
- **VenuesService**: Venue management and location queries
- **PricesService**: Price comparison and tracking
- **ArtistsService**: Artist data and relationships

### Adding Features

1. **New Filters**: Extend `EventSearchParams` type and update `EventFilters` component
2. **Map Features**: Add new marker types or overlays in `EventMap` component  
3. **Data Queries**: Create new RPC functions in Supabase and corresponding service methods

## Performance Considerations

- **Map Clustering**: Events are clustered for better performance with large datasets
- **Pagination**: List views use efficient pagination to handle large result sets
- **Spatial Indexing**: PostGIS indexes enable fast location-based queries
- **Price Snapshots**: Efficient snapshot-based price tracking reduces query load
